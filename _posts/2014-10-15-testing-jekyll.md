### Transition to Jekyll
<p>Last week, I've discovered Jekyll and immediately fall in love with it. It's simple, easy to configure and deploy, especially using Github pages.
For some one like me who doesn't have the time to write much, it's perfect.The use of Markdown syntax makes writing very accessible.
With that ends my first post and hopefully more to come very soon.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading.</p>
